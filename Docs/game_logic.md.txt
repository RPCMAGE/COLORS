# COLORS — Game Logic

## Overview
COLORS is a multi-color betting game inspired by the Filipino carnival “Perya” color game.  
It brings nostalgic simplicity to Web3 through a degen-style, fast-paced color dice roll.

Players bet on colors; three dice are rolled. Payouts depend on how many of the dice match the color(s) the player chose.
